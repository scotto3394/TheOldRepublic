# TheOldRepublic
Learning project with a Star Wars flair

This particular branch uses the programming language [Rust](http://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/) which will be necessary to build and test these files. 

Overview
=============================
Overall the intention of this project is to build a multiplayer RPG system, inspired by concepts from Star Wars: The Old Republic and Dungeons & Dragons. Mainly the goal of this project is to provide a fun side project to practice and build our coding skills, and possibly down the line as a fun game to play amonst ourselves. 

A very, very rough map involves:

1. Building the core data structures and game systems, involving ways to build characters/NPCs/Enemies. As this solidifies, skill sets, combat mechanics, and whatever strikes our imagination should be incorporated as well.
2. Since the goal is to eventually have an experience that can be shared amonst multiple players, building network communication and means of sharing data between players is essential. Choice of architecture is undecided at the moment.
3. As we progress, there will no doubt be attempts to improve user experience from cleaner interfaces and a smoother game experience. This could include anything from windows to incorporating maps and movement. Lots of opportunities based on how we end up exploring and learning.

Current Development
===============================

Core
-------------------------------
This will encompass what each player character (pc) and non-player character (npc) is capable of and the way data about them is represented/stored. 

Combat
-------------------------------
This module will incorporate many of the mathematics and dice rolls that come about in any adventure. Building upon the core module, this will take relevant character data and allow for smooth behind-the-scenes interaction with other characters. 

Network
-------------------------------
This module will attempt to build the basic behavior needed to communicate actions between players, and hence the multiplayer experience. 


Help
===============================
This will be the section for build instructions and other aspects such as running the program. At the moment, there is nothing to build
